This is my project for the Spring-Advanced course from the Java-Web module in Softuni.
This is a simple online computer game store. 
Roles are implemented using spring security. Users can register, login and browse games.
A simple shopping cart functionality lets the user pick games and order them. 
Admin role can add new games, edit them, delete them and see all orders
