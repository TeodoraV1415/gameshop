This is my project for the Spring-Advanced course from the Java-Web module in Softuni.
This is a simple online computer game store. 
Roles are implemented using spring security. Users can register, login, browse games and review them.
A simple shopping cart functionality lets the user pick their favourite games and make an order. 
Admin role can add new games, edit them, delete them and see all orders made by users.
