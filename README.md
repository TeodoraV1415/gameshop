Gameshop is my project for the Spring-Advanced course from the Java-Web module in Softuni.
It is a simple online computer game store where everyone can order their favourite games or leave a review.

Guests can only browse games.

Admins can add new games, edit or delete them and see user orders.
The app has one default admin users which can give other users admin rights.
Admin details for login:
username and password: admin

User registration is required to use the full functionality of the website such as viewing game details and ordering.

Technology stack:
    Spring Boot
    Spring MVC
    Spring Data JPA
    MySQL
    Spring Security
    Thymeleaf
    Bootstrap 5
